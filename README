Gregor Rozman has been so kind to make a program that translates a 3D object format file into source code for Vertigo 0.23. This may save you for a lot of work, if you want to create a new graphics object. I have not tested the program very well myself and neither do I have the source code, so please rely on the accompanying documentation and direct any questions to Gregor.
